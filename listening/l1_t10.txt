Part-time jobs make (#5 time/them) (#5 super/so) tired, (#5 the will/they) fall asleep in class.
I agree.
I know school (#5 ?/hours) (#5 a/are) short, but (#5 there's/this) homework as well.
And children need a lot of sleep.
Young children perhaps, but some boy (#5 step/stay at) school until they are 18 or 19.
A part-time job can't harm them.
In fact, it's good for them.
They (#5 will/earn) (#6 ?/their) (#5 pocket/pocket-money) instead of asking for their parents for it.
And they see something of the world outside the school.
Your (#1 absoutly/absolutely) right.

(#1 ?/Are they) (#5 go/good) for school children or not.
(#1 Denfinally/Definitely) not, (#6 ?/the) children (#5 has/have) (#6 ?/got) two (#5 part-time/full-time) jobs already, growing up and going to school.
Part-time jobs make (#5 time/them) (#5 super/so) tired, (#5 the will/they) fall asleep in class.
I agree.
I know school (#5 ?/hours) (#5 a/are) short, but (#5 there’s/this) homework as well.
And children need a lot of sleep.
Young children perhaps, but some boy (#5 step/stay at) school until they are 18 or 19.
A part-time job can’t harm them.
In fact, it’s good for them.
They (#5 will/earn) (#6 ?/their) (#5 pocket/pocket-money) instead of asking for their parents for it.
And they see something of the world outside the school.
Your (#1 absoutly/absolutely) right.
Boys learn a lot from a part-time job.
And we (#5 must/mustn’t) forget that some families need the (#1 extre/extra) money.
If the (#1 ?/pupils) didn’t take part time jobs, they couldn’t (#5 stay at/the) school.
Well, we same to be equally divided, (#5 to/two) for and (#5 to/two) against.
What do (#1 I #/our readrs) think?
